# We only want to import specific functions from the lidar library that we are using
# so we use the from ... import ... statement.
# In this example, we are importing the BAUDRATE, lidarConnect, lidarDisconnect, process_scan, lidarStatus, startScan, performSingleScan, and printScanHistogram functions from the lidar.alex_lidar library.

# In python, we define functions using the def keyword. The function name is followed by parentheses and a colon.
# Python uses indentation to define the scope of the function. Everything indented under the function definition is part of the function.

    Prints a histogram of the LIDAR scan data. 
    
    The histogram is displayed as a grid of characters, where each character represents a distance measurement. The grid is divided into rows and columns, with each row corresponding to a range of distances and each column corresponding to an angle. The maximum distance in the scan is used to determine the height of the grid, and the distances are normalized to fit within the specified number of rows. 
    
    The grid is then filled with characters based on the distances, with a different character used for distances above and below a certain threshold.

    Args:
        distances (list): A list of distance measurements from the LIDAR scan.
        angles (list): A list of angles corresponding to the distance measurements.
        rows (int, optional): The number of rows in the histogram grid. Defaults to 10.
